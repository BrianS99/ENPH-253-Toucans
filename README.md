# ENPH-253-Toucans

## Notes:
- in case the claw can't pick up the can on the first try and needs to come back down to try again, DON'T close the claw all the way bc then the claw will land on top of the can, just close it enough so that the claw doesn't land on the wall but open enough that it doesn't hit the can

- line the claw with more rubber bands, on both sides!
- cotton ball or similar at the back/sides of the hopper, to reduce can bouncing back out

claw switch alternatives:
- have the sensor on the claw poll continuously for the can - this is better than switch bc can confirm that the can is being held the whole time, can react quicker if can is dropped and won't store an "imaginary" can which would waste a space in the reservoir
